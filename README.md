![Start](start.jpg)

You know that offline Chrome game where the dinosaur jumps over cacti?  
Yeah, I recreated that — but with **background music**, a bit of flair, and some personal touches 🎮🎶

## ⚛️ React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React running with Vite.  
It comes pre-configured with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules for faster development.

Currently supported official plugins:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react): Uses Babel to enable Fast Refresh
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses SWC to enable Fast Refresh

## 🧹 Recommended ESLint Enhancements

For production-ready apps, I highly recommend using **TypeScript** with **type-aware linting**.

You can integrate:
- `typescript`
- `@typescript-eslint`

Check out the official [TypeScript template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for a quick start!

## 🎵 Background Music

The BGM is a **fan-made MIDI arrangement** of a Mario series track.  
I recreated it by ear using **Studio One** just for fun — purely for non-commercial, nostalgic purposes.  
All rights to the original music belong to **Nintendo**.
